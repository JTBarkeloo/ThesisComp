\chapter{Additional Plots from NN Studies}

Various additional plots are shown in this appendix from the neural network creation and studies.  Figure \ref{fig:VarPlots4} and \ref{fig:VarPlots5} show additional shape comparisons in variables which are not included in the final neural network model as they do not significantly change the fit values.  In the cases of $p_T$ or $E$ variables with the higher separation value were used as there is a large correlation between the two values and the other is shown in this appendix.  $\Delta R_{jb}$ was not included as the other 3 $\Delta R$ values had higher separation values and they are all related to each other as they are the geometrically related. 

The neutrino reconstruction is done using a minimization of \[ \chi^2_{\nu} = \chi^2_{bW} + \chi^2_{W} \].  All three were investigated for their separation values and the $\chi^2_{W}$ value had the largest separation.
