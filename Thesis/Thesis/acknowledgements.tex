\acknowledge{%Thanks go here.


I would like to thank the University of Oregon ATLAS group that helped me throughout my time in Oregon and Europe.  From the post-docs who always offered their support in answering my inane questions: Walter Hopkins, Kate Whalen, Jochen Heinrich, Aparajita Dattagupta, and Ismet Siral to the graduate and undergraduate students who worked alongside me: John Myers, Ian Snyder, Amanda Steinhebel, Ben Allen, Elliot Parrish, Davis Austin, Joey Carlson, Eli Meyer, and Tyler Burch.  Thank you also to the other professors in our group who always had open doors to answer questions and provide support: Stephanie Majewski, Eric Torrence, and Laura Jeanty.  And the one holding this all together and simplifying so much along the way Anne McGinley.

Also, thank you to the professors who have supported and advised me along this journey from my time at Wittenberg and Miami through the end of my academic career at the University of Oregon: Elizabeth George, Paul Voytas, Samir Bali, Richard Taylor, and most of all my current advisor Jim Brau.  Thank you to the remaining members of my committee for helping steer me in the right direction: David Strom, Spencer Chang, and Dev Sinha.

To my family who have always been there for me and provided so much more support than you could ever know, thank you.

Finally, and most importantly, thank you to my Anna.  I cannot imagine what my life in Oregon would have been like without your love and support.
