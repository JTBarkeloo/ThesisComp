\acknowledge{%Thanks go here.

To my fellow undergrads, grads, and post-docs at Oregon: Walter, Kate, Aparajita, Chris, Liza, Max, Peter, Ian, Jason, John, Johan, Elliot, Bri, Amanda, Aaron, and many more. Thank you all for for encouragement, help, questions, and camraderie.

My dijet partners-in-crime: James, Marco, Matteo, Karishma, Kate, Meghan, Caterina.  Thank you for showing me the ropes and suffering along side me through each pressing deadline.

For Sarah, who kicked my butt into going to grad school, who thought we'd never end up in Oregon, much less Europe.  Thank you for being my support and my travel buddy, and forcing me to go outside.

For January, who refused to nap and let this be written.
