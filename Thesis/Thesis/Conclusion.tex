\label{ch:Conclusion}
%Deep thoughts go here.
Various theories predicting physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics are constantly being tested and the Standard Model has stood up to these test time and time again.  It is imperative to continuing proding at the Standard Model from every angle to find pieces of the Standard Model that arent completely consistent with experimental observation.  Top quarks provide an ideal avenue to search for these deviations from the expected as they are produced in record numbers at the Large Hadron Collider.  This search has set limits on the $t\rightarrow q \gamma$ process which, in turn, helps to limit future theoretical models which predict enhancements to the flavor changing neutral current process.

\section{Comparison with Complementary Searches}

The previous ATLAS search result in the production mode \cite{GregorFCNC} suggested a similar result in the up quark channel due to the enhancement achieved taking advantage of the parton density function of the protons being collided.  While the up quark channel is very competetive the charm channel limit is weaker, due to the parton density function.  

The search presented in this dissertation is final state quark independent as the flavor changing neutral current decay should not favor a single light quark final state.  Therefore, the limits achieved searching in the decay mode provide strong bounds on both final states. 

\section{Future Directions}
The prospects of repeating this search throughout the remaining lifetime of the LHC with similar energies and luminosities should provide a statistical benefit to lower the limit further, the exact amount depends on the amount of statistics and total amount of $t\bar{t}$ pairs the LHC is able to produce.  The High-Luminosity LHC will create a large number of top pair events as the ATLAS experiment will be able to collect more data daster which results in a larger dataset to search for new physics with top quarks.  Further increases in energy for circular colliders such as the LHC also provide a large increase in statistics as the probability to produce heavy particles increases and the $t\bar{t}$ cross section goes up significantly.  The cross section increased by almost a factor of 3 from the LHC Run-1 $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV to the $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and continues to grow with center of mass energy.

Beyond the lifetime of the LHC, precision experiments are expected to be continually performed.  These searches would be performed at, for example, the International Linear Collider \cite{Buesser:2013pza} or various proposed circular colliders such as the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) and the Future Circular Collider-hadron electron (FCC-he)\cite{Benedikt:2015kqj}.  Future searches are expected to be able to push the sensitivities to branching ratios up to two orders of magnitude smaller than presented in this dissertation\cite{Cakir:2018ruj} benefitting from much cleaner datasets (linear colliders, operating near the energy required to directly produce $t\bar{t}$ pairs) or a significantly greater amount of data (circular colliders).

\section{Conclusion}

A search has been performed to search for the flavor changing neutral current decay in top quark pair events ($t\bar{t}\rightarrow bl\nu q \gamma$) at the LHC.  Using the entire Run-2 dataset collected by the ATLAS detector between 2015 and 2018 while the LHC was operating at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.  As no signal has been observed an observed (expected) upper limit on the branching ratio BR($t\rightarrow q \gamma$) $<$ BRANCHINGRATIO has been presented.  This limit offers the most stringent limits . . . .% Change, add branching ratio, finish based on final result...
