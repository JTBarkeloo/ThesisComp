Dijet events are studied in the proton--proton collision dataset recorded at $\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 37~\ifb. Invariant mass distributions are compared to background predictions and no significant deviation is observed. A new method for fitting the background component of the invariant mass distribution is employed. The dataset is used to set upper limits at a 95\% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Excited quarks with masses below 6.0 TeV are excluded, and limits are set on quantum black holes, heavy W' bosons, W* bosons, and a range of masses and couplings in a Z' dark matter mediator model. These results represent a substantial improvement over those obtained previously with lower integrated luminosity.
